Project 1
AUTHOR: Marco Preciado



DESCRIPTION:
This project will provide some insight about how multi-processes are created and the behavior.
The project include two .c files: oss.c, worker.c. worker.c will be given one argument. The argument is
will determine the amount of loops the worker c will produce. During the loop a statement will be printed
with the following information: pid, parent pid, iteration count. oss.c is responsible for the creation of
the worker. oss.c will have many options that a user can supply. An option is the amount of workers to create.
Another is how many loops workers will produce. Finally, how many workers will run simultaneously.

USAGE:
The user will provide an option to and an argurment to provide to program oss.
Here are the options:
-n argument, where argument is the total workers to launch
-s argument, where argument is the number passed to worker to process
-t argument, where argument is the number of children run simultaneously

The user must provide atleast 1 option. By default all options start with one.
For example if a user wants to run 10 workers and make each worker loop 4 times with 5 workers running simultaneously it will be...

./oss -n 10 -s 5 -t 4



LOGS:
2-8-2023 8:07pm I am in the process of creating loops for the instantiation of multple workers
