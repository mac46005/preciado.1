Project 1
AUTHOR: Marco Preciado



DESCRIPTION:
This project will provide some insight about how multi-processes are created and the behavior.
The project include two .c files: oss.c, worker.c. worker.c will be given one argument. The argument is
will determine the amount of loops the worker c will produce. During the loop a statement will be printed
with the following information: pid, parent pid, iteration count. oss.c is responsible for the creation of
the worker. oss.c will have many options that a user can supply. An option is the amount of workers to create.
Another is how many loops workers will produce. Finally, how many workers will run simultaneously.
